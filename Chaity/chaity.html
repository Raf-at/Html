	<p> There is nothing special about it. It's got that title we talked about, a couple of paragraphs and the tech support email at the bottom in the footer and if I click on it nothing actually happens but if we look at document number two we see that HTML is Structure Only heading is now green and a much bigger title and we see that the position of it has moved to the center. And we also see that the second paragraph is in the center and it's much bigger font compared to before and if we click on the email address that we talked about, we see an alert gets popped up with the message emailing us is useless, which sounds just about right for most people's experiences with tech support. So the thing to notice here is that the difference between the two HTML document are the up styles and the behavior applied but the structure of both HTML documents is exactly the same.</p>
